I love you baby
Ohhh
I really do
You don't have to think baby
I'm givin' all my love to you

When you're down in trouble just call on me
I'll set you free and easy
When you're feeling weird you got nothing to fear
Tell it to me and you'll soon see

I love you baby
Ohhh
I really do
You love me baby
I know it in my heart that you do

When I'm inside out and the wrong way around
You put my feet on the ground
When I'm inbetween a couple of scenes
You shook me from the bad dream

I love you baby
Ohhh
I really do
You love me baby
I see it in your eyes that you do
Oh yeah

(intrumental break)

When you're down in trouble just call on me
I'll set you free and easy
When you're feeling weird you got nothing to fear
Tell it to me and you'll soon see

I love you baby
Ohhh
I really do
You don't have to think baby
I'm givin' all my
I'm givin' all my love to you

I'm livin' all my love for you
'Cause I love you baby
Ooh, I really do

I love you lady
