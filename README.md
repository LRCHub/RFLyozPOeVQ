[00:09.38] As I walk by the seaside, as I walk through the grass
[00:14.27] I see the little bluebirds making love while I pass
[00:18.99] Bees are humming and they're singing everywhere
[00:23.71] And everyone's in love
[00:34.71] 
[00:27.20] Ohohoho
[00:29.82] I love you baby, I love you so
[00:33.39] I need you honey, I'll never let you go
[00:37.96] 'Cause you're the girl in my heart, you're the one I adore
[01:06.96] 
[00:42.82] And I love you
[00:49.82] 
[00:50.03] As I walk by the schoolyard, as I walk by the gate
[00:53.95] I see the weeping willow where we'd kiss on every date
[00:58.30] And carved in the bark, you'll find an arrow and a heart
[01:03.01] And underneath it says
[01:14.01] 
[01:07.44] Ohohoho
[01:09.00] I love you baby, I love you so
[01:13.44] I need you honey, I'll never let you go
[01:17.42] 'Cause you're the girl in my heart, you're the one I adore
[01:46.42] 
[01:22.07] And I love you
[01:29.07] 
[01:32.01] As I walk to the corner and I pass a candy store
[01:48.53] I hear the very music that I once heard before
[01:52.92] Oh, how you held me as the music softly played
[01:58.03] I was so in love
[02:06.03] 
[02:01.51] Ohohoho
[02:04.54] I love you baby, I love you so
[02:07.58] I need you honey, I'll never let you go
[02:11.50] 'Cause you're the girl in my heart, you're the one I adore
[02:40.50] 
[02:16.68] And I love you
[02:21.58] And I love you
[02:26.15] And I love you
