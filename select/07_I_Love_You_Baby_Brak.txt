Zorak: Yeah.

Brak: I love you, baby, I love the way that you walk,
I love you, baby, I love the way that you talk,
I really like it when you call my name - "Hey Braky Wacky!"
Oh, I like your sister, I like your Aunt Louise,
I like your doggie, hey, I even like its fleas!
I really like it when you tickle me - hee hee hee hee, STOP IT!
Somebody left a cake out in the rain, OH NO!
I was gonna eat that cake, but now it's all wet and I don't think I want any!

We could get married, just the two of us,
And you could get a job driving a school bus.
I love you, baby, will you marry me?
You don't have to decide right away. Think it over.
Who's it gonna hurt?
Where you going?
